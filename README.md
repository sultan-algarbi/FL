# Privacy-Preserving AI Framework using Federated Learning

## The problem:
Data plays an important role in machine learning due to its impact on model performance. Data collection has many challenges, one of the most important is data privacy, where most of the data owners do not share their data for many reasons.

## Solution:
To effectively address this challenge, federated learning can be used. In federated learning, each client trains a sub-model at its site using only local data, and then the different clients will share their sub-models in order to reach a consensus on a global model.
